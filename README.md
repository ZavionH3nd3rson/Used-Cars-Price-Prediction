Developed a machine learning model to predict used car prices by analyzing key features that influenced price. Compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, ultimately selecting Random Forest as the most accurate based on RÂ² and RMSE. Utilized feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation to optimize pricing predictions for real-world applications.
