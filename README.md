Developed a machine learning model to predict used car prices by analyzing key features that influenced price. Compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, ultimately selecting Random Forest as the most accurate model based on RÂ²(accuracy) and RMSE(error) evaluation metrics. Utilized feature engineering, data preprocessing, data visualizations and model evaluation to optimize pricing predictions for real-world application.

Key Insights: 

1. Best Accuracy: Highest Rsquared score; Lowest 'RMSE', meaning better genralization
2. Can handle non-linearity well compared to our linear regression model, and captures complex relationships between features effeciently
3. Reduces and prevents overfitting by taking the average of multiple trees
4. By conducting a feature importance analysis it allows us to interpret which variables influence pricing the most
